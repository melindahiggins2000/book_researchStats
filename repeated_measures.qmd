# One Outcome - Multiple Predictors and/or Covariates

This chapter will get into why dependence matters - usually time within subject but could be any nested structure data...

* continuous outcome - usual linear regression
    - bootstrapping
    - permutations
    - simulations - maybe
    - bayesian
    
* can also do this for categorical, binary, poisson, and other generalized outcomes...
