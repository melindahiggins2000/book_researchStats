# Comparison of 3 or more Independent Groups

The focus of this chapter is methods for comparing 3 or more independent groups

* ANOVA - including post hoc tests
* Kruskal-Wallis test - including post hoc tests with adjusted p-values
* bootstrapping
* permutations
* simulations - maybe
* bayesian
* using a regression approach (dummary variables - thinking about multiple comparisons)
* using a GLM approach (e.g. F-test = t-test squared)

* add a discussion of effect sizes for each of these approaches
