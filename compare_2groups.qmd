# Comparison of 2 Independent Groups

The focus of this chapter is mainly comparing 2 independent groups

* t-tests
* Mann Whitney test
* bootstrapping
* permutations
* simulations - maybe
* bayesian
* using a regression approach
* using a GLM approach (e.g. F-test = t-test squared)

* add a discussion of effect sizes for each of these approaches
